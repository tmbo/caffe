# Please generate the neccessary data files with 
# /path/to/caffe/tools/extra/parse_log.sh before plotting.
# Example usage: 
#     ./parse_log.sh mnist.log
# Now you have mnist.log.train and mnist.log.test.
#     gnuplot mnist.gnuplot

# The fields present in the data files that are usually proper to plot along
# the y axis are test accuracy, test loss, training loss, and learning rate.
# Those should plot along the x axis are training iterations and seconds.
# Possible combinations:
# 1. Test accuracy (test score 0) vs. training iterations / time;
# 2. Test loss (test score 1) time;
# 3. Training loss vs. training iterations / time;
# 4. Learning rate vs. training iterations / time;
# A rarer one: Training time vs. iterations.
